# Overview
The Hackathon does not care what tools you use to help implement your ideas. This repository was setup to help people form teams and upload code prior to the event. The website and emails link to this [repository](https://github.com/hack-hunterdon/hackathon/) so participants can start exploring.  We sent team invitations to all those who entered their GitHub user names at registration.

This is our first time providing the service, open to suggestions, at the moment we are taking a free-form open-source approach here.  Browse through our [list of hackers](https://github.com/orgs/hack-hunterdon/people).  If you have a project already setup on GitHub please send us a project name, link, and description and we will add it to the table below.
